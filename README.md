This library implements a complete XPath 2 Parser in Java 11, using [Parboiled](https://github.com/sirthias/parboiled).

The parser generates an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) which you can then use in your own application for whatever you wish. The class [XPathUtil](https://github.com/exquery/xpath2-parser/blob/master/src/main/java/com/evolvedbinary/xpath/parser/XPathUtil.java) shows how the parser can be used. You can also execute `XPathUtil` as an application if you want to understand the node-tree produced by the parser.


Obtaining
---------
The [compiled artifact](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22com.evolvedbinary.xpath%22%20AND%20a%3A%22xpath2-parser%22) can be obtained from Maven Central by adding the following to the `<dependencies>` section of your `pom.xml`:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.evolvedbinary.xpath</groupId>
    <artifactId>xpath2-parser</artifactId>
    <version>1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

If you are a Scala, Groovy or Clojure person then you can still use the artifact from Maven Central with your favourite build tool, however I will assume you know what your doing ;-)


Future Work
-----------
* Provide some tutorials or better documentation
* Update this to XPath 3.1...
